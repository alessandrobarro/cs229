\item\subquestionpoints{5} \textbf{Classical (Unsupervised) EM Implementation.}
For this sub-question, we are only going to consider the $\nexp$ unlabelled examples. Follow the instructions in \texttt{src/semi\_supervised\_em/gmm.py} to implement the traditional EM algorithm, and run it on the unlabelled data-set until convergence.

Run three trials and use the provided plotting function to construct a scatter plot of the resulting assignments to clusters (one plot for each trial). Your plot should indicate cluster assignments with colors they got assigned to (\emph{i.e.,} the cluster which had the highest probability in the final E-step).

\textbf{Submit the three plots obtained above in your write-up.}
