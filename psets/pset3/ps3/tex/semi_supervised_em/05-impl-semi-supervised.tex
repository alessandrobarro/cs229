\item\subquestionpoints{7} \textbf{Semi-supervised EM Implementation.}
Now we will consider both the labelled and unlabelled examples (a total of $\nexp + \tilde{\nexp}$), with 5 labelled examples per cluster. We have provided starter code for splitting the dataset into matrices \texttt{x} and \texttt{x\_tilde} of unlabelled and labelled examples respectively. Add to your code in \texttt{src/semi\_supervised\_em/gmm.py} to implement the modified EM algorithm, and run it on the dataset until convergence.

Create a plot for each trial, as done in the previous sub-question.

\textbf{Submit the three plots obtained above in your write-up.}
