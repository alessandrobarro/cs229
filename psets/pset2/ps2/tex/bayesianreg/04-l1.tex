\item \subquestionpoints{5} Next, consider the Laplace distribution, whose density is
given by

\begin{align*}
  f_{\mathcal{L}}(z|\mu ,b)={\dfrac{1}{2b}}
  \exp \left(-{\dfrac{|z-\mu |}{b}}\right).
\end{align*}


As before, consider a linear regression model given by
$y=x^T\theta+\epsilon$ where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$. Assume a Laplace
prior on this model, where each parameter $\theta_i$ is marginally independent, and
is distributed as $\theta_i \sim \mathcal{L}(0,b)$.

Show that $\theta_\text{MAP}$ in this case is equivalent to the solution of linear
regression with $L_1$ regularization, whose loss is specified as

$$J(\theta) = || X\theta - \vec{y} ||_2^2 + \gamma ||\theta||_1 $$

Also, what is the value of $\gamma$?

\textbf{Note:} A closed form solution for linear regression problem with $L_1$ regularization
does not exist. To optimize this, we use gradient descent with a random initialization
and solve it numerically.
